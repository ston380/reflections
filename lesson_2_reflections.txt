Initializing a repository creates the infrastructure necessary to start
accepting commits and basically creates an empty repository without any files.

The staging area gives more control over the workflow and commits. While working
directory shows all files in the project, specifying only certain ones to the
staging area gives confidence that those will be the only files affected by the
commit. In a word, it clarifies the process.
