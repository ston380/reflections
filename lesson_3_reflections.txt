Remote repositories allow multiple people to work on a project or allow you to
sync changes you've made yourself on another computer. Standard advantages of
cloud computing.

Manually pulling remote repositories makes it easier to consciously stay up to
date on the changes. Automatic pulling may in some cases make it more difficult
to understand all the changes made by other people.

Forks, clones and branches have very different purposes. While a clone is
essentially a prepository cloned in its current state to your local
device, forking creates that "copy" in GitHub. This means you now have access
to a remote repository with all the data in the forked original repository and
allows you to seamlessly work on that repository with all the benefits of cloud
computing. A branch is a totally different concept and is all about implementing
new ideas without the risk of messing up the project, but with the option to
incorporate new features after they have been completed by merging the
successful idea in the experimental branch to the master branch.
